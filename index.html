          Avengers: Infinity War is a 2018 American superhero film based on the
          Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. In the film, the Avengers
          and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from
          collecting the six all-powerful Infinity Stones as part of his quest
          to kill half of all life in the universe. In the end, Thanos snaps his
          fingers and utilizes the full power of the unified Infinity stones.
